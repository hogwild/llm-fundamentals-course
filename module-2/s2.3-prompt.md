## Knowledge Point 1: Going Deeper with Residual Connections

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** In our previous session, we explored the transformer block structure. How do we effectively stack multiple transformer blocks to create deeper networks? What difficulties arise when stacking many layers, and how are these addressed?

#### The Deep Learning Challenge

Modern language models stack many transformer blocks to achieve greater capabilities:
- GPT-3: 96 transformer blocks
- BERT-Large: 24 transformer blocks
- PaLM: 118 transformer blocks

However, training very deep neural networks has historically been challenging due to:
- **Vanishing/exploding gradients**: Signal degrades as it passes through many layers
- **Optimization difficulties**: The training process becomes unstable
- **Degradation problem**: Adding more layers can actually hurt performance

> **Everyday Analogy**: Imagine playing the game "telephone" where a message is passed through many people. By the time it reaches the end, the message is often distorted or lost. Deep neural networks face a similar problem - information can get distorted as it passes through many layers.

#### Residual Connections: The Solution

Residual connections (or skip connections) solve these problems by adding the input of a layer directly to its output:

```
output = input + Layer(input)
```

This simple addition transforms what each layer needs to learn:
- Instead of learning the complete transformation, the layer learns the "difference" or "residual"
- If a layer has nothing useful to add, it can learn to produce values close to zero

> **Everyday Analogy**: Think of each layer as a reviewer suggesting edits to a document. With residual connections, each reviewer doesn't rewrite the entire document - they just suggest changes (the "residual") to the original. If a reviewer has no useful changes, they can simply return the document unchanged.

#### Deep Transformer Architecture

In transformers, residual connections appear around both main components within each block:
1. After the attention layer
2. After the feed-forward network

This creates information highways throughout the network, allowing signals to flow more easily in both forward and backward passes.

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why are residual connections important for training deep networks?
- How does learning "residuals" differ from learning complete transformations?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Residual Connections

Here's how to implement residual connections in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ResidualConnection(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, sublayer, d_model, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.sublayer = sublayer
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Apply normalization first (Pre-LN style)
        normalized = self.norm(x)
        
        # Apply sublayer (attention or feed-forward)
        sublayer_output = self.sublayer(normalized)
        
        # Apply dropout to sublayer output
        sublayer_output = self.dropout(sublayer_output)
        
        # Add the original input (residual connection)
        return x + sublayer_output

# Example usage with a simple feed-forward layer
d_model = 64
ff_layer = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(d_model, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, d_model)
)

res_connection = ResidualConnection(ff_layer, d_model)

# Create a sample input
x = torch.randn(10, d_model)

# Pass through residual connection
output = res_connection(x)
print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}, Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

**Practice Exercise**: Implement a stack of transformer blocks with residual connections and visualize the information flow through the network.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Residual Networks and Iterative Refinement

An insightful way to understand residual networks is through the lens of iterative algorithms and differential equations. Consider the continuous limit of residual networks:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = F(x(t), t)$$

This is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) where $x(t)$ represents the hidden state and $F$ is the transformation function. In this view:

- Each residual layer performs a small update step along this continuous transformation
- Deeper networks approximate this continuous process with more steps
- The skip connections ensure the stability of this numerical approximation

This perspective reveals why deeper models can perform more complex reasoning - they effectively have more "thinking steps" to refine their representations.

#### Mathematical Analysis of Gradient Flow

Residual connections dramatically improve gradient flow through deep networks. For a network with $L$ layers, the gradient of the loss $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to an early layer $l$ is:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_l} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_L} \prod_{i=l}^{L-1} \frac{\partial x_{i+1}}{\partial x_i}$$

With residual connections, this becomes:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_l} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x_L} \prod_{i=l}^{L-1} \left(1 + \frac{\partial F_i(x_i)}{\partial x_i}\right)$$

The addition of "1" in each term prevents the gradient from vanishing, even when $\frac{\partial F_i(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$ is small.

**Research Reference**: "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (He et al., 2016) introduced residual connections, which were later adopted by transformers.

## Knowledge Point 2: Pre-training: Teaching Models to Predict Tokens

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** With the architecture in place, how do we actually teach these models to understand and generate language?

#### The Simple Yet Powerful Training Objective

At its core, pre-training a language model involves a conceptually simple task: predict the next token based on previous tokens.

> **Everyday Analogy**: Imagine playing a fill-in-the-blank game with increasingly difficult sentences. After practicing with millions of examples, you'd develop an intuitive understanding of language patterns, grammar, and even factual knowledge - all from learning to fill in blanks correctly.

#### How Pre-training Works

The process involves these key elements:

1. **The Training Objective**: Minimize the negative log-likelihood of the correct next token:
   - For each position in the text, predict the probability distribution over the next token
   - Maximize the probability assigned to the token that actually appears next

2. **Massive, Diverse Training Data**:
   - Books and literature
   - Web pages from diverse domains
   - Wikipedia and reference materials
   - Code repositories
   - Scientific publications
   - Social media (filtered for quality)

3. **Iterative Learning Process**:
   - Process text in chunks
   - Make predictions at each position
   - Compare predictions to actual next tokens
   - Update model parameters to improve predictions
   - Repeat for billions of examples

#### What the Model Learns

Through this conceptually simple task, the model implicitly learns:
- Grammar and syntax
- Word meanings and relationships
- Common facts about the world
- Basic reasoning patterns
- Domain-specific knowledge

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why is predicting the next token such a powerful learning objective?
- How can a model learn factual knowledge just from predicting text?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Next-Token Prediction Training

Here's how to implement a simple next-token prediction training loop in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

def train_language_model(model, data_loader, optimizer, num_epochs):
    """Train a language model on next-token prediction."""
    model.train()
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        
        for batch in data_loader:
            # Get token indices batch
            inputs = batch[:, :-1]  # All tokens except the last
            targets = batch[:, 1:]  # All tokens except the first
            
            # Clear gradients
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Forward pass
            logits = model(inputs)
            
            # Reshape for cross entropy
            batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size = logits.shape
            logits = logits.reshape(batch_size * seq_len, vocab_size)
            targets = targets.reshape(batch_size * seq_len)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss = criterion(logits, targets)
            
            # Backward pass
            loss.backward()
            
            # Update weights
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
        
        avg_loss = total_loss / len(data_loader)
        perplexity = torch.exp(torch.tensor(avg_loss))
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}, Perplexity: {perplexity:.4f}")
```

**Practice Exercise**: Create a small dataset and train a simple transformer model on next-token prediction.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Information Theory Perspective

From an information theory perspective, language modeling can be understood as estimating the true probability distribution of language:

$$p_{\text{model}}(x) \approx p_{\text{true}}(x)$$

The cross-entropy loss minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{true}}}[-\log p_{\text{model}}(x)]$$

As this divergence decreases, the model becomes better at compressing language (Shannon's source coding theorem), which requires understanding its patterns and structure.

#### Distribution Estimation vs. Downstream Tasks

While pre-training only involves next-token prediction, research shows that this objective is sufficient for learning representations useful for diverse downstream tasks:
- Classification
- Question answering
- Summarization
- Translation
- Code generation

This suggests that the ability to predict language distributions is a powerful proxy for general language understanding.

**Research Reference**: "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners" (Radford et al., 2019) demonstrated that language modeling is a rich pre-training task that enables zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks.

## Knowledge Point 3: Scaling Laws: The Relationship Between Size and Capability

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** How do we know how large to make these models, and what happens when we increase their size?

#### The Surprising Discovery of Scaling Laws

One of the most remarkable findings in LLM research is that performance improves predictably with scale. As we increase three key resources, performance follows power-law relationships:

1. **Model Size**: Number of parameters in the model
2. **Training Data**: Amount of text used for training
3. **Compute**: Total computation used during training

> **Everyday Analogy**: Think of learning a language. The more vocabulary you learn (model size), the more examples you study (training data), and the more practice you get (compute), the better you become - but not in a linear way. Each doubling of effort doesn't double your skill; instead, improvements follow mathematical patterns.

#### The Power Law Pattern

These relationships typically look like:

```
Performance improvement ∝ (Resource increase)^power
```

Where the power is less than 1, indicating diminishing returns - but importantly, the returns never stop completely.

#### Emergent Capabilities

Most fascinatingly, certain capabilities seem to "emerge" only after models reach sufficient scale:
- In-context learning (using examples in the prompt)
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Complex instruction following
- Creative generation

These abilities weren't explicitly programmed but arose naturally as models scaled up.

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why do larger models tend to perform better on language tasks?
- What are emergent capabilities, and why are they significant?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Exploring Scaling Effects

Here's how to implement a simple experiment to observe scaling behavior:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

def measure_scaling_effect(model_sizes, data_sizes, train_epochs=3):
    """Measure how performance scales with model and data size."""
    results = []
    
    for model_size in model_sizes:
        for data_size in data_sizes:
            # Create model of given size
            model = create_model(model_size)
            
            # Create dataset of given size
            dataset = create_dataset(data_size)
            data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
            
            # Train model
            optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
            final_loss = train_model(model, data_loader, optimizer, train_epochs)
            
            results.append({
                'model_size': model_size,
                'data_size': data_size,
                'loss': final_loss
            })
    
    # Convert to numpy arrays for analysis
    model_sizes_arr = np.array([r['model_size'] for r in results])
    data_sizes_arr = np.array([r['data_size'] for r in results])
    losses = np.array([r['loss'] for r in results])
    
    # Plot results
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for data_size in np.unique(data_sizes_arr):
        mask = data_sizes_arr == data_size
        plt.loglog(model_sizes_arr[mask], losses[mask], 'o-', label=f'Data Size: {data_size}')
    
    plt.xlabel('Model Size (parameters)')
    plt.ylabel('Loss')
    plt.title('Scaling Laws: Loss vs Model Size')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True, which="both", ls="-")
    plt.show()
```

**Practice Exercise**: Implement the `create_model` and `create_dataset` functions to test scaling behavior on a simple language modeling task.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Mathematical Form of Scaling Laws

The scaling laws for language models typically follow this form:

$$L(N) \approx \alpha N^{-\beta}$$

Where:
- $L$ is the loss (lower is better)
- $N$ is the resource (parameters, tokens, or compute)
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants determined empirically

For neural language models, Kaplan et al. (2020) found:
- $\beta \approx 0.076$ for model size
- $\beta \approx 0.095$ for dataset size
- $\beta \approx 0.050$ for compute budget

#### Optimal Allocation of Resources

An important implication of scaling laws is the concept of "compute-optimal" scaling, which suggests:
- When increasing compute by 8x, model size should increase by 4x
- Training tokens should increase by 2x

This balances the benefits of larger models with the need for more training data, and has guided the development of models like GPT-3, PaLM, and others.

**Research Reference**: "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (Kaplan et al., 2020) established the mathematical relationships between model size, data size, compute, and performance.

## Knowledge Point 4: From Pre-training to Supervised Fine-tuning

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** Pre-trained models can generate text, but how do we adapt them to be helpful, harmless, and honest assistants?

#### Beyond Raw Text Prediction

A model trained solely on next-token prediction has limitations:
- It mimics training data without discernment
- It may generate harmful content
- It doesn't consistently follow instructions
- It lacks a coherent interaction style

> **Everyday Analogy**: Imagine someone who has read millions of books but never had a conversation. They might know facts and language patterns, but they wouldn't understand how to be helpful in a dialogue. That's the difference between a purely pre-trained model and one that's been fine-tuned to be an assistant.

#### The Supervised Fine-tuning Process

After pre-training, models undergo supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality examples:

1. **Creating a Demonstration Dataset**:
   - Human experts write examples of helpful responses to prompts
   - Examples show preferred reasoning, formatting, and tone
   - The dataset is much smaller than pre-training data (thousands to millions of examples)

2. **Fine-tuning Process**:
   - The pre-trained model continues training on these demonstrations
   - It uses a lower learning rate to avoid forgetting pre-trained knowledge
   - The objective shifts from pure prediction to emulating demonstration behavior

3. **Instruction Tuning**:
   - A specific type of SFT focused on following diverse instructions
   - Teaches the model to interpret and execute various types of requests
   - Includes multi-turn conversations with back-and-forth interactions

#### Impacts of Fine-tuning

After SFT, models exhibit dramatically different behavior:
- Better adherence to instructions
- More consistent, helpful tone
- Ability to follow multi-step directions
- Improved response formatting and structure
- Safer outputs that avoid harmful content

**Understanding Check ✓**
- How does supervised fine-tuning differ from pre-training?
- Why can't we simply instruct a pre-trained model to be helpful without fine-tuning?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Supervised Fine-tuning

Here's how to implement supervised fine-tuning in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class InstructionDataset(Dataset):
    """Dataset for instruction tuning with prompt-response pairs."""
    def __init__(self, prompts, responses, tokenizer, max_length=512):
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.prompt_tokens = []
        self.response_tokens = []
        self.max_length = max_length
        
        for prompt, response in zip(prompts, responses):
            # Format as instruction with special tokens
            prompt_tok = tokenizer.encode(f"<s>{prompt}", max_length=max_length//2, truncation=True)
            response_tok = tokenizer.encode(f"{response}</s>", max_length=max_length//2, truncation=True)
            
            self.prompt_tokens.append(prompt_tok)
            self.response_tokens.append(response_tok)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.prompt_tokens)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Combine prompt and response for next-token prediction
        full_sequence = self.prompt_tokens[idx] + self.response_tokens[idx]
        
        # Create input_ids and attention_mask
        inputs = torch.tensor(full_sequence[:-1])
        targets = torch.tensor(full_sequence[1:])
        
        return {"inputs": inputs, "targets": targets}

def supervised_fine_tune(pretrained_model, instruction_dataloader, num_epochs=3, learning_rate=1e-5):
    """Fine-tune a pre-trained model on instruction data."""
    # Set up optimizer with low learning rate
    optimizer = optim.AdamW(pretrained_model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
    
    # Use standard cross-entropy loss
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    pretrained_model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        
        for batch in instruction_dataloader:
            inputs = batch["inputs"].to(device)
            targets = batch["targets"].to(device)
            
            # Clear gradients
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Forward pass
            logits = pretrained_model(inputs)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss = criterion(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), targets.view(-1))
            
            # Backward pass
            loss.backward()
            
            # Gradient clipping to prevent instability
            torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(pretrained_model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
            
            # Update weights
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
        
        avg_loss = total_loss / len(instruction_dataloader)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")
    
    return pretrained_model
```

**Practice Exercise**: Create a small instruction dataset and fine-tune a pre-trained model to follow simple instructions.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning

Instead of updating all model parameters (which can be expensive for large models), several efficient approaches have been developed:

1. **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**:
   - Approximates weight updates using low-rank matrices
   - Updates only a small number of parameters while freezing most of the model
   - Mathematically: $W + \Delta W = W + BA$ where $B$ and $A$ are low-rank matrices

2. **Prompt Tuning**:
   - Learns continuous prompt embeddings while keeping the model fixed
   - Only updates a small set of "soft prompt" tokens

3. **Adapter Layers**:
   - Inserts small trainable modules between existing layers
   - Leaves most of the original model unchanged

These approaches often achieve comparable performance to full fine-tuning with just 0.1-1% of the parameters.

#### The Alignment Challenge

While supervised fine-tuning significantly improves model behavior, truly aligning models with human values requires additional techniques, which we'll explore in Module 3:
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Constitutional AI approaches
- Red-teaming and safety evaluations

**Research Reference**: "Fine-tuning Language Models from Human Preferences" (Ziegler et al., 2019) laid groundwork for aligning language models with human preferences.

## Knowledge Point 5: Computational Challenges and Solutions in LLM Training

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** What practical challenges arise when training models with hundreds of billions of parameters, and how are these addressed?

#### The Scale of the Challenge

Training modern LLMs requires enormous computational resources:
- GPT-3 (175B parameters): Estimated training cost of $4-12 million
- PaLM (540B parameters): Required thousands of specialized AI chips
- Training runs lasting weeks to months

> **Everyday Analogy**: Imagine trying to coordinate thousands of people to collectively solve a single puzzle. Each person handles one small piece, but they all need to communicate constantly to ensure everything fits together. That's similar to the coordination challenge when training across thousands of specialized chips.

#### Memory Constraints

The first major challenge is that modern LLMs don't fit in the memory of a single GPU:

- **Solution 1: Model Parallelism**
  Split the model across multiple devices:
  - Different layers on different devices
  - Different parts of the same layer on different devices
  
- **Solution 2: Data Parallelism**
  Each device handles a portion of the training batch:
  - All devices have a copy of the model
  - Each processes different examples
  - Results are combined to update the model

#### Training Stability

Very large models are prone to training instabilities:

- **Solution 1: Careful Initialization**
  Special initialization methods prevent unstable gradients
  
- **Solution 2: Learning Rate Schedules**
  Gradual warmup and decay of learning rates
  
- **Solution 3: Gradient Clipping**
  Prevent extreme gradient values that could derail training

#### Inference Optimization

Once trained, using LLMs efficiently presents additional challenges:

- **Solution 1: Quantization**
  Reduce precision from 32-bit to 8-bit or even 4-bit
  
- **Solution 2: Distillation**
  Train smaller models to mimic larger ones
  
- **Solution 3: Caching**
  Store computed values to avoid redundant calculations

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why can't we simply train large language models on a single powerful computer?
- How do techniques like model parallelism and quantization help address computational challenges?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Basic Model Parallelism

Here's a simplified implementation of model parallelism across GPUs:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DistributedTransformerLayer(nn.Module):
    """A transformer layer distributed across two GPUs."""
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, d_ff):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Self-attention on GPU 0
        self.self_attention = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, num_heads).to('cuda:0')
        
        # Feed-forward network on GPU 1
        self.feed_forward = FeedForward(d_model, d_ff).to('cuda:1')
        
        # Layer norms on respective GPUs
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model).to('cuda:0')
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model).to('cuda:1')
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Input starts on CPU
        x = x.to('cuda:0')
        
        # Attention block on GPU 0
        norm_x = self.norm1(x)
        attn_output = self.self_attention(norm_x)
        x = x + attn_output
        
        # Transfer to GPU 1
        x = x.to('cuda:1')
        
        # Feed-forward block on GPU 1
        norm_x = self.norm2(x)
        ff_output = self.feed_forward(norm_x)
        x = x + ff_output
        
        # Return to CPU for potential further processing
        return x.to('cpu')

# Example usage
layer = DistributedTransformerLayer(d_model=768, num_heads=12, d_ff=3072)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 128, 768)  # [batch_size, seq_len, d_model]
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

**Practice Exercise**: Implement a simple quantization function to convert model weights from float32 to int8 precision.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Advanced Parallelism Strategies

Modern LLM training employs sophisticated parallelism strategies:

1. **Pipeline Parallelism**:
   - Splits the model vertically across devices
   - Different devices process different stages in a pipeline
   - Mathematically modeled as $T_{total} \approx \frac{n}{p} + p$ where $n$ is the number of layers and $p$ is the number of pipeline stages

2. **Tensor Parallelism**:
   - Splits individual operations (e.g., matrix multiplications)
   - Mathematically: $AB = [A_1, A_2, ..., A_k][B_1, B_2, ..., B_k]^T = \sum_{i=1}^{k} A_i B_i^T$
   - Each device computes one term in the sum

3. **Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)**:
   - Partitions optimizer states, gradients, and parameters
   - Reduces memory requirements without affecting computation
   - Three stages of increasing memory efficiency

#### Hardware-Software Co-design

The most advanced training systems involve co-designing hardware and software:
- Custom interconnects between processing units
- Specialized memory hierarchies
- Hardware-aware model implementations
- Compiler optimizations for specific hardware targets

**Research Reference**: "Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism" (Shoeybi et al., 2019) introduced innovative parallelism techniques that enabled training of extremely large language models.

## Reflection and Synthesis

### Integration Activity (For Everyone)

Let's connect what we've learned across Module 2 to build a complete picture of modern LLMs:

**From Individual Components to Complete Systems**:

1. **Session 2.1** showed how transformers process text using tokens instead of words and how position information is preserved despite parallel processing.

2. **Session 2.2** revealed how attention mechanisms find relevant context and how feed-forward networks store knowledge, combining into transformer blocks.

3. **Session 2.3** explored how these blocks are stacked using residual connections, how models are trained at scale, and the progression from pre-training to fine-tuning.

**Key Principles Emerged Across These Sessions**:

1. **Simple Objectives, Complex Capabilities**: Next-token prediction, a conceptually simple task, leads to rich language understanding when scaled appropriately.

2. **Modular Design**: Transformers derive their power from combining specialized components into reusable blocks.

3. **Scale Changes Behavior**: As models grow in size and are exposed to more data, entirely new capabilities emerge.

4. **Beyond Architecture**: The full development of an LLM involves careful data curation, training methodology, and fine-tuning practices.

### Key Questions to Consider

- How does the transformer architecture enable the emergent capabilities we see in modern LLMs?
- What limitations might arise from the choices made in model architecture and training?
- How might these systems continue to evolve in the coming years?

### Looking Forward

In Module 3, we'll build on this foundation to explore:
- How models develop reasoning capabilities
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Alignment with human values
- Advanced capabilities and limitations
