# Module 2: Transformer Architecture and Modern LLM Training

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2 of the LLM4LLM learning series! This module bridges the gap between the foundational concepts from Module 1 and the powerful transformer architecture behind today's Large Language Models.

In Module 1, we explored:
- Next-word prediction as the core task of language modeling
- Simple n-gram models and their limitations
- Neural representations and embeddings
- Early neural language models
- Word2Vec and specialized embedding techniques

Now, Module 2 will reveal how modern transformer-based LLMs dramatically extend these foundations to create vastly more powerful language processing systems.

## Learning for Different Audiences

This module is designed to serve three distinct audiences with varying backgrounds:

### For Non-CS Readers
If you're new to computer science or just want to understand the key concepts:
- Focus on the "Core Concepts" sections in each session
- Pay special attention to the everyday analogies
- Use the visual resources to build intuition
- Skip the implementation details and mathematical derivations

### For CS Students
If you have a computer science background and want hands-on experience:
- Complete both "Core Concepts" and "Hands-On Implementation" sections
- Work through the PyTorch code examples
- Implement the practice exercises to reinforce your understanding
- Experiment with the provided implementations

### For Advanced Learners
If you're looking for deeper insights and connections:
- Explore all sections, including "Advanced Theory"
- Dive into the mathematical formulations
- Review the recommended research papers
- Challenge yourself with extended implementation tasks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand how transformers process text using tokens rather than words
- Explain how position information is preserved in parallel processing
- Recognize how feed-forward networks store factual knowledge
- Comprehend attention mechanisms and their role in finding relevant context
- Describe how transformer blocks are structured and stacked
- Understand how residual connections enable deeper architectures
- Explain the modern LLM training process from pre-training to fine-tuning

## Sessions

### [Session 2.1: Tokens and Positions in Transformer Models](./s2.1-prompt.md)

Discover how modern LLMs efficiently handle language through subword tokenization rather than word-level processing, and how they preserve positional information despite parallel processing.

**Key Concepts:**
- Power laws in language and subword tokenization
- Position embeddings and sequence information
- Combining tokens and positions

### [Session 2.2: Building a Transformer Block: Attention and Knowledge Storage](./s2.2-prompt.md)

Explore the revolutionary attention mechanism that allows tokens to find relevant context across sequences, and see how transformer blocks combine attention with feed-forward networks for knowledge storage.

**Key Concepts:**
- Feed-forward networks as knowledge stores
- Self-attention mechanisms for finding context
- Multi-head attention for capturing different relationships
- The transformer block architecture

### [Session 2.3: Scaling and Training Modern LLMs](./s2.3-prompt.md)

Learn how transformer models are scaled to unprecedented sizes, trained on massive datasets, and fine-tuned to become helpful assistants.

**Key Concepts:**
- Residual connections for deep networks
- Pre-training objectives and scaling laws
- From pre-training to supervised fine-tuning
- Computational challenges in LLM training

## Navigation and Learning Support

### Interactive Learning Commands
Throughout your learning journey, use these commands to customize your experience:

- Say "next" to proceed to the next knowledge point
- Say "go" to begin exploring the current knowledge point
- Say "deeper" to explore a concept in more technical detail
- Say "background" to revisit foundational ideas
- Say "visual" to see diagrams that illustrate complex concepts
- Say "math" to see mathematical formulations
- Say "paper" to explore relevant academic references

### Visual Resources
Each session includes visual aids to help you understand complex concepts:
- Diagrams of transformer architecture components
- Visualizations of attention patterns
- Illustrations of training processes
- Charts showing scaling relationships

### Hands-On Components
For CS students, each session provides:
- PyTorch implementations of key components
- Code examples that you can run and modify
- Practice exercises to reinforce learning
- Implementation challenges to extend your understanding

## Connection to Module 1 and Preview of Module 3

### Building on Module 1
Module 2 extends the foundational concepts from Module 1:
- The next-token prediction objective remains central but enables more complex emergent capabilities
- Word embeddings evolve into tokenized representations with position information
- Sequential processing is replaced by parallel attention mechanisms
- Simple neural networks develop into sophisticated transformer blocks

### Looking Ahead to Module 3
After completing Module 2, you'll be prepared for Module 3, which explores:
- How models develop reasoning capabilities
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Alignment with human values and intentions
- Advanced capabilities and limitations

## Using this Module Effectively

1. **Start with Session 2.1** and progress sequentially through the sessions
2. **Match the content to your background**:
   - If you're a non-CS reader, focus on Core Concepts
   - If you're a CS student, include the Hands-On Implementation sections
   - If you're seeking advanced understanding, explore the Advanced Theory sections
3. **Use the navigation commands** to customize depth based on your interests
4. **Complete the reflection activities** at the end of each session
5. **Review the post-prompt evaluation** after each session to track your learning

Remember, the goal of this module is not just to understand transformer architecture technically, but to build an intuitive understanding of how these systems work and why they're so powerful for language processing.

Let's begin exploring the fascinating world of transformer-based language models!
