You're right. After reviewing the content, the README for Module 2 could use some modifications to better align with your teaching approach for different audience types and to improve the learning experience. Here's how I'd optimize the Module 2 README:

# Module 2: Transformer Architecture and Modern LLM Training

## Building on Module 1 Foundations

Module 1 introduced you to the core concepts of language modeling. Now, Module 2 bridges the gap between those foundational ideas and the powerful transformer architecture behind today's Large Language Models.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand how transformers process text using tokens rather than whole words
- Explain how position information is preserved in parallel processing
- Recognize the role of attention in finding relevant context
- Describe how transformer blocks combine attention with knowledge storage
- Understand the modern LLM training process from pre-training to fine-tuning

## For Different Learning Paths

This module is designed to accommodate different backgrounds and learning goals:

### For Non-CS Readers
- Focus on the "Core Concepts" sections in each session
- Pay special attention to analogies and visualizations
- Use the "Understanding Check" questions to confirm your grasp of key ideas

### For CS Students
- Complete both "Core Concepts" and "Hands-On Implementation" sections
- Work through the code examples in PyTorch
- Try the practice exercises to reinforce your understanding

### For Advanced Exploration
- Explore the "Advanced Theory" sections for deeper mathematical foundations
- Review the recommended research papers
- Challenge yourself with the extended implementation tasks

## Sessions

### [Session 2.1: Tokens and Positions in Transformer Models](./s2.1-prompt.md)
Discover why modern LLMs use tokens instead of words, how position information is encoded, and how these elements combine to form the input to transformers.

**Key Concepts:**
- Power laws in language and subword tokenization
- Position embeddings and sequence information
- Combining tokens and positions

### [Session 2.2: Building a Transformer Block: Attention and Knowledge Storage](./s2.2-prompt.md)
Explore attention mechanisms as the key innovation in transformer models, and see how they work together with feed-forward networks to process language.

**Key Concepts:**
- Feed-forward networks as knowledge stores
- Self-attention mechanisms for finding context
- Multi-head attention for capturing different relationships
- The transformer block architecture

### [Session 2.3: Scaling and Training Modern LLMs](./s2.3-prompt.md)
Learn how transformer models are trained at scale and how they progress from raw text prediction to helpful assistants.

**Key Concepts:**
- Residual connections for deep networks
- Pre-training objectives and scaling laws
- From pre-training to supervised fine-tuning
- Computational challenges in LLM training

## Navigation Tips

- Use the command "deeper" when you want to explore a concept in more technical detail
- Use "background" to revisit foundational ideas that support current topics
- Request "visual" to see diagrams that illustrate complex concepts
- Say "math" when you're ready to see the mathematical formulations
- For programming practice, say "more practice" to get additional exercises

## Connection to Module 1 and Preview of Module 3

This module builds directly on Module 1 by showing how the transformer architecture extends and improves upon earlier approaches to language modeling. After completing Module 2, you'll be prepared for Module 3, which explores how models develop reasoning capabilities and how they're aligned with human values and intentions.

## Learning Resources

Each session includes:
- Intuitive explanations with real-world analogies
- Visual diagrams to illustrate concepts
- PyTorch code examples (for CS students)
- Mathematical formulations (for advanced learners)
- Practice exercises at varying difficulty levels

Remember to use the evaluation framework in post-prompt.md after completing each session to track your learning progress.
