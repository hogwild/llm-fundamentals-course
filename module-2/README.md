Looking at your planned content for Module 2, I can sketch a README that aligns with this focus. Regarding Knowledge Point 6 in Session 1.5, I think it could be streamlined or merged with KP5 since the limitations naturally lead to discussing what comes next.

Here's a sketch of the README for Module 2:

# Module 2: Transformer Architecture and Modern LLM Training

This module explores the architecture that powers today's Large Language Models, focusing on the transformer design and how these models are trained to follow instructions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand how transformers process tokenized text rather than words
- Explain how position information is preserved in transformers
- Recognize how feed-forward networks store factual knowledge
- Comprehend attention mechanisms and their role in finding relevant context
- Describe how transformer blocks are structured and stacked
- Understand how residual connections enable deeper architectures
- Explain the modern LLM training process from pre-training to instruction tuning

## Sessions

### [Session 2.1: Tokens, Positions, and Feed-Forward Networks](./session-2.1/)
Explore why modern LLMs operate on tokens instead of words, how position information is encoded, and how feed-forward networks act as knowledge storage within transformers.

### [Session 2.2: Attention Mechanisms and Transformer Blocks](./session-2.2/)
Discover how attention mechanisms find relevant information across the context window and how transformer blocks combine attention with feed-forward networks.

### [Session 2.3: Scaling and Training Modern LLMs](./session-2.3/)
Learn how residual connections enable deeper networks, and explore the complete training pipeline from pre-training on raw text to instruction tuning.

## Key Concepts

- **Tokenization vs words**: Why subword tokens handle long-tail distributions better
- **Position embeddings**: Preserving sequential information in transformers
- **Feed-forward networks**: How factual knowledge is stored within the model
- **Attention mechanisms**: Finding relevant information across the context
- **Transformer blocks**: The fundamental computational unit of modern LLMs
- **Residual connections**: The optimization technique enabling deeper architectures
- **Pre-training and instruction tuning**: The two-phase approach to modern LLM training

## Comments on your plan:

Your coverage plan for Module 2 follows a logical progression that builds on the foundations established in Module 1. A few thoughts:

1. The transition from words to tokens is very important and often confusing for students - good to see it's the first topic.

2. I'd suggest ensuring you explicitly connect position embeddings to the limitation from Module 1 (static word embeddings don't account for position).

3. The "FFN to store knowledge" concept might benefit from concrete examples of what kind of knowledge is stored and how we know this.

4. For attention mechanisms, it might be helpful to contrast with the fixed context of n-grams and the limitations of static neural models from Module 1.

5. The residual connection explanation should address why deeper networks are beneficial in the first place.

6. The pre-training and instruction tuning section could connect back to Session 1.1's discussion of how instruction following emerges from prediction.

Would you like me to expand any particular section of this sketch in more detail?
