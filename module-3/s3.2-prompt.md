# Session 3.2: Beyond Pattern Matching to Reasoning: Test-Time Computation

## Primary Question
How do language models evolve from pattern-matching to reasoning through test-time computation and leveraging the thought process itself as data?

## Knowledge Points Overview
This session covers the following key knowledge points:
1. The limits of pattern extraction: The diminishing returns of data scaling
2. Chain-of-thought reasoning: Making thinking visible
3. Test-time computation: Dynamic reasoning during inference
4. Learning to reason: How models are trained to think step by step

## Knowledge Point 1: The Limits of Pattern Extraction: The Diminishing Returns of Data Scaling

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** Current large language models have been trained on enormous datasets - what happens when we've extracted all the patterns we can from available text? How might models continue to improve?

#### The Data Scaling Law and Its Limits

LLMs have benefited tremendously from scaling three dimensions:
- More parameters (model size)
- More compute (training resources)
- More data (training examples)

However, scaling laws suggest diminishing returns, especially for data:
- Each doubling of data yields smaller and smaller improvements
- High-quality data suitable for training is finite
- Many domains have already been extensively incorporated

![Data Scaling Curve](/api/placeholder/600/300)

> **Everyday Analogy:** Think of learning a language by reading books. Initially, each new book teaches you many new words and phrases. But after reading thousands of books, you encounter fewer and fewer new patterns, even though your mastery isn't complete.

#### The Pattern-Matching Ceiling

Even with unlimited data of the current type, pattern-matching alone faces fundamental limitations:

1. **Complex Reasoning Gap**:
   - Many problems require multi-step reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition
   - Example: Mathematical proofs, logical puzzles, or planning tasks

2. **Novel Situation Challenge**:
   - Real-world problems often present unique combinations of elements
   - Rare or unprecedented situations have little direct representation in training data

3. **Computational Inefficiency**:
   - Encoding all possible reasoning chains directly in parameters is inefficient
   - The model would need to memorize solutions rather than understanding processes

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why can't we just solve all reasoning problems by feeding more examples into training data?
- What kinds of tasks might be difficult even for models that have seen virtually all human-written text?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Exploring the Limits of Pattern Recognition

Let's examine how current models might struggle with complex reasoning despite strong pattern-matching abilities:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained language model
model_name = "gpt2-large"  # Or another available model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

def generate_completion(prompt, max_length=100):
    """Generate text completion using the pre-trained model."""
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    generation_output = model.generate(
        input_ids=inputs.input_ids,
        attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,
        max_length=len(inputs.input_ids[0]) + max_length,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_p=0.9,
        do_sample=True
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Test reasoning challenges that demonstrate the pattern-matching ceiling
reasoning_challenges = [
    # Mathematical reasoning with novel combinations
    "If x + y = 10 and x - y = 4, what are the values of x and y?",
    
    # Multi-step logic puzzle
    "Three people (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) each have either a black or white hat. No one can see their own hat, but each can see the others'. If Alice says she can't determine her hat color, and then Bob says he can't determine his hat color, what color is Charlie's hat?",
    
    # Algorithmic thinking
    "Describe an efficient algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array."
]

for i, challenge in enumerate(reasoning_challenges):
    print(f"Challenge {i+1}: {challenge}")
    response = generate_completion(challenge)
    print(f"Response: {response}\n")
    print("-" * 80)
```

**Practice Exercise:** Try to create your own reasoning challenges that would be difficult for pattern-matching alone. Consider problems that require:
1. Multiple interrelated steps of logic
2. Novel combinations of concepts
3. Self-correction and backtracking

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### The Information-Theoretic View

From an information theory perspective, training on text data has inherent limitations:

1. **The Implicit Reasoning Problem**:
   - Much human reasoning is implicit in text, not explicitly stated
   - Text rarely captures our internal cognitive processes and false starts
   - Learning from outputs alone misses the algorithm that produced them

2. **Shannon Information Limits**:
   - There's a theoretical limit to how much information can be extracted from a finite corpus
   - As models approach this limit, gains from additional data become negligible

3. **The Solomonoff Induction Challenge**:
   - Finding the simplest hypothesis that explains observed data is computationally intractable
   - Pattern matching approximates this but struggles with complex causal relationships

**Research References**:
- "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models" (Kaplan et al., 2020)
- "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models" (Hoffmann et al., 2022)

#### Reflection Point
Before continuing, consider: If more data isn't the complete answer, what alternative approaches might help models develop stronger reasoning abilities? How do humans learn to reason beyond simple pattern recognition?

---

## Knowledge Point 2: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Making Thinking Visible

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** When you solve a difficult problem, do you immediately know the answer, or do you work through steps? How might making a model's "thinking" explicit improve its reasoning?

#### From Direct Answers to Step-by-Step Reasoning

Traditional language model prompting asks for direct answers:
- Input: "What's 27 × 15?"
- Output: "405"

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reveals the reasoning process:
- Input: "What's 27 × 15? Let's solve step by step."
- Output: "To multiply 27 × 15, I'll break it down:
  27 × 10 = 270
  27 × 5 = 135
  270 + 135 = 405
  So 27 × 15 = 405"

![Chain of Thought vs Direct Answer](/api/placeholder/600/300)

> **Everyday Analogy:** Think of a math teacher evaluating two students. One student writes only the final answer, while the other shows all their work. Even if both reach the correct answer, the teacher gains much more insight from seeing the step-by-step process, and can identify exactly where any mistakes occur.

#### Why Chain-of-Thought Works

Chain-of-Thought reasoning provides several key benefits:

1. **Decomposition of Complex Problems**:
   - Breaks difficult tasks into manageable steps
   - Allows the model to focus on one sub-problem at a time

2. **Working Memory Enhancement**:
   - Serves as an external "scratch pad" for intermediate results
   - Reduces the burden on limited context window capacity

3. **Error Detection and Correction**:
   - Makes reasoning errors visible and fixable
   - Enables backtracking when a line of reasoning proves incorrect

4. **Alignment with Human Reasoning**:
   - Matches how humans actually solve complex problems
   - Makes model reasoning transparent and interpretable

**Understanding Check ✓**
- Why might breaking down a complex problem into steps help a language model reach a correct answer?
- How is chain-of-thought reasoning different from simply providing more examples in the prompt?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Let's see how we can implement and evaluate chain-of-thought reasoning:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained language model
model_name = "gpt2-large"  # Or another available model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

def generate_completion(prompt, max_length=200):
    """Generate text completion using the pre-trained model."""
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    generation_output = model.generate(
        input_ids=inputs.input_ids,
        attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,
        max_length=len(inputs.input_ids[0]) + max_length,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_p=0.9,
        do_sample=True
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Compare direct answers vs. chain-of-thought reasoning
reasoning_problems = [
    # Arithmetic problem
    {
        "problem": "If I have 15 apples and give 6 to my friend, then buy 4 more, how many apples do I have?",
        "direct_prompt": "If I have 15 apples and give 6 to my friend, then buy 4 more, how many apples do I have?",
        "cot_prompt": "If I have 15 apples and give 6 to my friend, then buy 4 more, how many apples do I have? Let's solve this step-by-step."
    },
    
    # Logic problem
    {
        "problem": "All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales are mammals. Are whales warm-blooded?",
        "direct_prompt": "All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales are mammals. Are whales warm-blooded?",
        "cot_prompt": "All mammals are warm-blooded. All whales are mammals. Are whales warm-blooded? Let's think through this logically."
    }
]

for i, problem in enumerate(reasoning_problems):
    print(f"Problem {i+1}: {problem['problem']}")
    
    print("\nDirect Answer:")
    direct_response = generate_completion(problem['direct_prompt'])
    print(direct_response)
    
    print("\nChain-of-Thought Answer:")
    cot_response = generate_completion(problem['cot_prompt'])
    print(cot_response)
    
    print("-" * 80)
```

**Practice Exercise:** Create a few examples of chain-of-thought reasoning for different types of problems (e.g., mathematical, logical, planning). Then try prompting a language model with these examples followed by a new problem to see if it learns to apply the chain-of-thought pattern.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### In-Context Learning as Emergent Reasoning

Chain-of-thought is part of a broader phenomenon called in-context learning, where models learn from examples in the prompt:

1. **Few-Shot Learning**:
   - Models can adapt to new tasks with just a few examples
   - No parameter updates required, just contextual adaptation

2. **Emergent Abilities**:
   - Advanced reasoning abilities appear suddenly at certain scale thresholds
   - These abilities aren't explicitly trained for but emerge as model size increases

3. **Meta-Learning Connection**:
   - In-context learning resembles meta-learning or "learning to learn"
   - The model implicitly learns strategies for adapting to new tasks

**Research References**:
- "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022)
- "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022)

#### Reflection Point
Before continuing, consider: How much of human reasoning is about following explicit steps versus intuitive pattern matching? Can language models truly "reason" or are they just mimicking the form of human reasoning?

---

## Knowledge Point 3: Test-Time Computation: Dynamic Reasoning During Inference

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** What if we could give language models "thinking time" to explore different approaches to a problem before committing to an answer? How would this change their problem-solving abilities?

#### From Static Generation to Dynamic Computation

Traditional language model inference is a single forward pass:
- Input → Model → Output

Test-time computation introduces a dynamic reasoning process:
- Input → Model → [Explore different approaches] → Verify → Refine → Output

![Test-Time Computation Process](/api/placeholder/600/300)

> **Everyday Analogy:** Consider the difference between taking a multiple-choice test versus solving an open-ended problem. In the multiple-choice scenario, you must immediately commit to an answer. For open-ended problems, you can try different approaches, verify partial results, and backtrack if needed—much like test-time computation.

 It's "Dark"**:
   - Traditional training data shows only final answers, not the process
   - Human thinking processes are largely invisible in text corpora
   - Most reasoning happens "in the dark" - unobserved in training

3. **Illuminating Dark Data Through Test-Time Computation**:
   - Allow models to generate their own reasoning traces
   - Explore multiple potential solution paths
   - Use self-consistency to validate solutions
   - Apply verification to catch and correct mistakes

#### Key Test-Time Computation Strategies

Several approaches enable dynamic reasoning during inference:

1. **Self-Consistency**:
   - Generate multiple reasoning paths for the same problem
   - Compare different solutions for consistency
   - Select the most common or confident answer

2. **Verification**:
   - Check intermediate results and final answers
   - Identify and correct errors in reasoning
   - Ensure conclusions follow from premises

3. **Tree Search**:
   - Explore multiple branching solution paths
   - Evaluate the promise of each approach
   - Backtrack from dead ends and continue exploration

**Understanding Check ✓**
- How does test-time computation differ from simply generating longer responses?
- Why might exploring multiple solution paths lead to better answers than just trying once?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Implementing Self-Consistency through Multiple Sampling

Let's implement a simple version of self-consistency for test-time computation:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from collections import Counter

# Load a pre-trained language model
model_name = "gpt2-large"  # Or another available model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

def generate_multiple_solutions(prompt, n_samples=5, max_length=200):
    """Generate multiple reasoning paths for the same problem."""
    solutions = []
    
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        # Use different sampling to get diversity
        generation_output = model.generate(
            input_ids=inputs.input_ids,
            attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask,
            max_length=len(inputs.input_ids[0]) + max_length,
            temperature=0.8,
            top_p=0.9,
            do_sample=True
        )
        solution = tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
        solutions.append(solution)
    
    return solutions

def extract_final_answer(solution, problem_type="math"):
    """Extract the final answer from a solution (simplified)."""
    # This is a simple extraction; in practice, you'd use more robust methods
    solution_lines = solution.strip().split("\n")
    if problem_type == "math":
        # Look for lines with "=" or "answer" or the last line
        for line in reversed(solution_lines):
            if "=" in line or "answer" in line.lower():
                # Try to extract a number
                import re
                numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', line)
                if numbers:
                    return numbers[-1]
        # Fallback to last line
        return solution_lines[-1]
    else:
        # For other types, just return the last line
        return solution_lines[-1]

def self_consistency_solve(problem, problem_type="math", n_samples=5):
    """Solve a problem using self-consistency approach."""
    cot_prompt = f"{problem} Let's solve this step-by-step."
    
    # Generate multiple solutions
    solutions = generate_multiple_solutions(cot_prompt, n_samples)
    
    # Extract final answers
    final_answers = [extract_final_answer(sol, problem_type) for sol in solutions]
    
    # Find the most common answer
    most_common_answer = Counter(final_answers).most_common(1)[0][0]
    
    return {
        "problem": problem,
        "solutions": solutions,
        "final_answers": final_answers,
        "most_common_answer": most_common_answer
    }

# Test self-consistency on problems
problems = [
    {
        "problem": "If 5 shirts cost $65, how much do 8 shirts cost?",
        "type": "math"
    },
    {
        "problem": "A ball and a bat cost $110 in total. The bat costs $100 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?",
        "type": "math"
    }
]

for problem_info in problems:
    result = self_consistency_solve(problem_info["problem"], problem_info["type"])
    
    print(f"Problem: {result['problem']}")
    print(f"Most common answer: {result['most_common_answer']}")
    print(f"All answers: {result['final_answers']}")
    print("\nSample solution path:")
    print(result['solutions'][0])
    print("-" * 80)
```

**Practice Exercise:** Extend the self-consistency implementation to include a verification step. After generating multiple solutions, have the model evaluate each solution for errors before determining the final answer.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Tree of Thought and Neural MCTS

More advanced test-time computation approaches leverage tree search algorithms:

1. **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**:
   - Generalizes chain-of-thought to a tree structure
   - Explores multiple reasoning branches in parallel
   - Uses the model itself to evaluate the promising paths
   - Combines thinking and evaluation dynamically

2. **Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
   - Adapts MCTS from game playing to reasoning
   - Balances exploration and exploitation of reasoning paths
   - Uses LLM as both policy and value function
   - Simulates multiple reasoning trajectories before committing

3. **Guided Decoding**:
   - Biases the sampling process during generation
   - Encourages exploration of promising directions
   - Applies constraints to maintain reasoning quality

**Research References**:
- "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models" (Yao et al., 2023)
- "Improving Language Model Inference Through Tree Search" (Henighan et al., 2023)

#### Reflection Point
Before continuing, consider: Is test-time computation just a computational trick, or does it reveal something fundamental about the nature of reasoning? How might models develop their own internal "thinking time" without explicit external orchestration?

---

## Knowledge Point 4: Learning to Reason: How Models Are Trained to Think Step by Step

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)

**Probing Question:** How can we train language models to develop better reasoning strategies on their own, rather than just prompting them differently?

#### From Prompted Reasoning to Learned Reasoning

While prompting techniques like chain-of-thought help models reason better, we can go further by training models to discover effective reasoning strategies:

- **Prompted Reasoning**: The human provides the reasoning structure
- **Learned Reasoning**: The model discovers optimal reasoning approaches

![Learned Reasoning Approach](/api/placeholder/600/300)

> **Everyday Analogy:** Consider the difference between following a recipe step-by-step (prompted reasoning) versus learning cooking principles that let you create your own recipes (learned reasoning). The latter requires deeper understanding but leads to more flexible and creative application.

#### Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning

Reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training models to reason:

1. **The Reasoning as Search Problem**:
   - Reasoning can be viewed as searching for a path to the solution
   - Different reasoning strategies lead to different search efficiencies
   - RL can discover optimal search strategies through trial and error

2. **Policy Learning for Reasoning**:
   - The policy determines how the model approaches problems
   - Learning happens by trying different reasoning strategies on problems
   - Strategies that lead to correct answers are reinforced

3. **Key Components of RL for Reasoning**:
   - **State**: The current problem and reasoning progress
   - **Actions**: Steps in the reasoning process
   - **Rewards**: Feedback based on correctness of answers
   - **Policy**: Strategy for selecting reasoning steps

**Understanding Check ✓**
- How does training a model to reason differ from simply prompting it to show its reasoning?
- Why might reinforcement learning be particularly well-suited for improving reasoning abilities?

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)

#### Simple RL for Reasoning Strategies

Here's a simplified implementation showing how reinforcement learning can be used to improve reasoning:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

class ReasoningPolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    """Simple policy network for guiding reasoning steps."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt2", hidden_size=768):
        super().__init__()

**Practice Exercise:** Extend this simplified implementation to include more diverse reasoning strategies and a more sophisticated reward function that considers not just correctness but also efficiency and clarity of reasoning.

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)

#### Guided Policy Optimization and Beyond

Recent advances have developed more sophisticated approaches to learning reasoning strategies:

1. **Guided Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO)**:
   - Eliminates the need for a separate reward model by using the model's own capabilities
   - The model performs "rollouts" where it extends its own reasoning paths
   - These rollouts help estimate the quality/value of different approaches
   - Simplifies the reinforcement learning pipeline by integrating evaluation within the model itself
   
   > **Key Innovation**: Traditional RLHF requires collecting preference data and training a separate reward model. GRPO instead uses the language model itself to evaluate responses through rollouts, creating a more integrated and efficient approach to learning reasoning strategies.
   
   > **Historical Connections**: This approach has conceptual roots in Monte Carlo rollouts from planning and game playing, bootstrapping methods in RL, and self-training techniques where a model's own predictions guide learning.

2. **Decision Transformers**:
   - Reformulate RL as a sequence modeling problem
   - Learn from trajectories of states, actions, and rewards
   - Can be fine-tuned using existing transformer architectures

3. **Process Supervision**:
   - Train models on the entire reasoning process, not just inputs and outputs
   - Use human-annotated reasoning traces as supervision signal
   - Develop specific loss functions for evaluating reasoning quality

#### Reflection Point
As we conclude this session, consider: How might these approaches to learning reasoning change how we think about AI capabilities? Are we moving from models that mimic human outputs to models that mimic human thinking processes?

## Reflection and Synthesis

### Integration Activity (For Everyone)

Let's connect the key concepts from this session to understand how language models can evolve from pattern-matching to reasoning:

![Reasoning Evolution](/api/placeholder/600/300)

1. **The Limits of Pattern Extraction**:
   - Pure pattern-matching faces diminishing returns from data scaling
   - Complex reasoning requires more than statistical pattern recognition
   - The "dark data" of human reasoning processes is largely invisible in training data

2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**:
   - Breaking problems into explicit steps helps models reason
   - Making thinking visible provides scaffolding for complex problems
   - This approach bridges pattern matching and more sophisticated reasoning

3. **Test-Time Computation**:
   - Dynamic reasoning during inference enables exploration of multiple paths
   - Self-consistency, verification, and tree search improve solution quality
   - These approaches simulate "thinking time" for neural networks

4. **Learning to Reason**:
   - Reinforcement learning helps models discover effective reasoning strategies
   - Policy-based approaches find paths through complex problem spaces
   - Guided optimization balances exploration and exploitation in reasoning

### Key Questions to Consider

- How much of human reasoning is consciously step-by-step versus intuitive pattern matching?
- Can language models develop genuine reasoning abilities, or are they just approximating human reasoning patterns?
- What might be the next frontier beyond current reasoning approaches for language models?
- How might these reasoning capabilities transfer to entirely new domains or problems?

### Next Steps Preview

In the next session, we'll explore:
- How reasoning capabilities can be extended to even more domains
- The relationship between reasoning and planning in language models
- Multimodal reasoning across text, images, and structured data
- The implications of reasoning models for tool use and agent behavior
