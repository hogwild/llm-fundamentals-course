You're right - the description of the special structure in Module 3's README refers to Session 3.4, but the formatting doesn't match the other session links. Let me correct that:

# Module 3: Reasoning and Alignment in Large Models

## Introduction

Module 3 explores the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, particularly their reasoning abilities and how they're aligned with human values and intentions. This module completes our journey by examining how these powerful models are guided to be helpful, harmless, and honest, and concludes with philosophical reflections on what these systems might truly "understand."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the alignment problem and why prediction alone isn't sufficient
- Explain how models are trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Recognize how chain-of-thought and step-by-step reasoning emerge in LLMs
- Analyze the balance between capabilities and alignment in modern systems
- Apply technical knowledge to classic philosophical questions about intelligence and understanding

## Sessions

### [Session 3.1: The Alignment Problem and RLHF](./s3.1-prompt.md)

Discover why simply predicting text isn't enough for helpful assistants, and how reinforcement learning from human feedback helps align models with human values.

**Key Concepts:**
- The alignment problem: helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty
- From prediction to preference
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Constitutional AI and self-supervision approaches

### [Session 3.2: Reasoning in Large Language Models](./s3.2-prompt.md)

Explore how large language models develop step-by-step reasoning capabilities and how prompting techniques can elicit more reliable reasoning.

**Key Concepts:**
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Step-by-step problem solving
- Reasoning as emergent behavior
- The role of scale in reasoning capabilities

### [Session 3.3: Advanced Capabilities and Limitations](./s3.3-prompt.md)

Examine the cutting-edge capabilities of modern LLMs as well as their fundamental limitations and ongoing challenges.

**Key Concepts:**
- World models and implicit knowledge representation
- Tool use and planning
- Factuality challenges and hallucinations
- Future directions in language model development

### [Session 3.4: Philosophical Perspectives on AI Understanding](./s3.4-prompt.md)

Circle back to fundamental philosophical questions about intelligence, understanding, and consciousness with new insights from your technical knowledge of LLMs.

**Key Concepts:**
- The Turing Test and intelligence assessment
- Symbol grounding and the Chinese Room argument
- Consciousness and subjective experience
- Simulation versus reality
- Embodiment and the future of AI understanding

## Session 3.4: Special Structure

[Session 3.4](./s3.4-prompt.md) follows a unique format where you'll engage with philosophical questions both before starting the technical curriculum and after completing it:

1. **First Pass (Beginning):** Answer philosophical questions based on your intuitive understanding
2. **Technical Learning:** Complete Modules 1-3 (Sessions 3.1-3.3)
3. **Second Pass (End):** Revisit the same questions with your new technical knowledge

This structure highlights how technical understanding transforms philosophical perspectives and connects abstract concepts to concrete mechanisms. Unlike other sessions, this one contains no code examples or mathematical formulations—it focuses purely on philosophical discussion and reflection.

## Recommended Approach

For the most enriching experience with Session 3.4:

1. Start by recording your first-pass answers to the philosophical questions before you begin the technical curriculum
2. Revisit these same questions after completing all other sessions
3. Look for ways that specific technical concepts (like attention, embeddings, or reinforcement learning) might transform how you think about these philosophical questions
4. Consider how your vocabulary and conceptual framework for discussing these questions has evolved

There are no "correct" answers to these philosophical questions—the goal is to deepen your understanding and develop a more nuanced perspective informed by technical knowledge.

## Connection to Previous Modules

Module 3 builds directly on the foundations established in earlier modules:

- It extends the transformer architecture from Module 2 to explore how these models develop reasoning capabilities
- It examines how the pre-training approach from Module 2 is enhanced with reinforcement learning
- It connects the token prediction objective from Module 1 to more complex forms of language understanding

By completing this module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of modern LLMs, from their foundational principles to their most advanced capabilities and philosophical implications.
