# Module 3: Reasoning and Alignment in Large Models

## Overview

Module 3 explores the advanced capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on how these systems move beyond pattern matching to implement reasoning and how they align with human values. This module builds on the foundational knowledge from Modules 1-2, examining how LLMs evolve from statistical prediction engines to systems that can perform complex reasoning and follow human preferences.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:
- Understand the alignment problem and why it's crucial for AI systems
- Explore how reinforcement learning enables models to learn from human feedback
- Examine test-time computation and how it enables dynamic reasoning
- Investigate chain-of-thought reasoning and other techniques that make thinking visible
- Connect the entire journey from basic language models to advanced reasoning systems

## Sessions

### Session 3.1: The Alignment Problem and Reinforcement Learning from Feedback
[s3.1-prompt.md](./s3.1-prompt.md)

This session explores how we ensure AI systems act according to human values and intentions:
- The alignment problem: Why prediction is not enough
- Reinforcement learning: Learning from outcomes
- From rewards to policies: How models improve from feedback
- The RLHF framework for language models

**Key Concepts:**
- Learning from humans rather than just predicting text
- Preference optimization vs. pattern memorization
- Reward modeling for capturing human values
- Reinforcement learning techniques for language models

### Session 3.2: Beyond Pattern Matching to Reasoning: Test-Time Computation
[s3.2-prompt.md](./s3.2-prompt.md)

This session investigates how language models can perform deliberate reasoning at inference time:
- The limits of pattern extraction: The diminishing returns of data scaling
- Chain-of-thought reasoning: Making thinking visible
- Test-time computation: Dynamic reasoning during inference
- Learning to reason: How models are trained to think step by step

**Key Concepts:**
- "Dark data" and why reasoning processes are rarely captured in training
- Self-consistency through multiple solution paths
- Tree search and exploration during inference
- Policy optimization for reasoning strategies

### Session 3.3: From Prediction to Reasoning - The Complete LLM Journey
[s3.3-prompt.md](./s3.3-prompt.md)

This concluding session synthesizes the entire course journey, connecting the progression from simple models to sophisticated reasoning systems:
- The evolution of prediction: From n-grams to neural reasoning
- Core machine learning foundations across the LLM stack
- The future frontier: Balancing capabilities with alignment

**Key Concepts:**
- Tracing the complete evolutionary path of LLM development
- Identifying the fundamental ML principles that span all approaches
- Exploring emerging trends and challenges in LLM development
- Reflecting on the dual challenge of capability and alignment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Module 1: Foundations of Word Prediction and Embeddings
- Module 2: Transformer Architecture and LLM Training

## Learning Format

Each session follows the standard three-part structure:
1. Begin with the [pre-prompt.md](../pre-prompt.md) to establish the learning framework
2. Work through the session prompt (e.g., [s3.1-prompt.md](./s3.1-prompt.md))
3. Complete with the [post-prompt.md](../post-prompt.md) for evaluation
