## Knowledge Point 1: Neural Language Model Output Layer and Softmax

**Probing Question**: How does a neural network convert its internal calculations into meaningful word predictions?

### Making Predictions Across Vocabulary
- **The Output Layer Challenge**:
  * Need to predict one word out of thousands in vocabulary
  * Each word needs a score/probability
  * Scores must be comparable across all words

- **Introduction to Softmax Function**:
  * Purpose: Convert raw scores to probabilities
  * Mathematical definition (in simple terms)
  * Properties: outputs sum to 1, preserves ranking, emphasizes high values

- **From Network Output to Word Prediction**:
  * Raw scores for each word in vocabulary
  * Apply softmax to get probability distribution
  * Select highest probability word or sample from distribution

- **Interactive Demonstration**: Visualize how softmax transforms scores into probabilities
  * Example: Raw scores [2.0, 1.0, 0.1] → Probabilities [0.67, 0.24, 0.09]
  * See how changing one score affects all probabilities

- **Visual Reference**: Examine a visualization of the softmax transformation from "The Illustrated Transformer" (Alammar, 2018, https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).

## Knowledge Point 2: Loss Functions and Error Measurement

**Probing Question**: How do we measure if a language model's predictions are good or bad, and what exactly are we trying to optimize?

### Measuring Prediction Quality
- **Introduction to Loss Functions**:
  * Purpose: Quantify prediction error
  * Desired properties: lower when prediction is better
  * Guide the learning process

- **Cross-Entropy Loss for Language Modeling**:
  * Measuring difference between predicted and actual probabilities
  * Why it's suitable for word prediction tasks
  * Simple intuition: penalizes wrong predictions, rewards correct ones

- **From Word-Level to Sequence-Level Evaluation**:
  * Perplexity: standard evaluation metric for language models
  * Relationship to cross-entropy loss
  * Intuitive meaning: model's confusion level when predicting

- **Conceptual Example**:
  * Correct next word: "cat"
  * Model predicts: {"cat": 0.3, "dog": 0.2, "hat": 0.1, ...}
  * Loss calculation focuses on probability assigned to "cat"

- **Visual Reference**: Examine a visualization of cross-entropy loss from "Deep Learning" (Goodfellow et al., 2016, MIT Press).

### Understanding Check ✓
- What is a loss function and why is it necessary for training?
- How does cross-entropy loss measure the quality of word predictions?
- Why might we care more about the probability of the correct word than the probabilities of incorrect words?

## Knowledge Point 3: Gradient Descent and Model Training

**Probing Question**: Once we know how wrong our predictions are, how do we actually improve the model?

### Learning from Mistakes
- **The Learning Challenge**:
  * Starting with random vectors and weights
  * Need to adjust to reduce prediction errors
  * Millions of parameters to tune simultaneously

- **Introduction to Gradient Descent**:
  * Gradient: direction of steepest increase in loss
  * Idea: move parameters in opposite direction to decrease loss
  * Learning rate: how big each adjustment step should be

- **The Training Process**:
  * Forward pass: make predictions
  * Calculate loss (error)
  * Backward pass: compute gradients
  * Update parameters
  * Repeat millions of times

- **Interactive Exploration**: Visualize gradient descent with UCLA's "Gradient Descent Visualizer" (https://uclaacm.github.io/gradient-descent-visualiser/) which shows how parameters update during training

- **Visual Reference**: Examine animations of gradient descent from Google's Machine Learning Crash Course.

### Understanding Check ✓
- What is gradient descent in simple terms?
- How does the learning process actually improve the model's predictions?
- Why do we need many iterations of this process to train a model?
