## Implementation Notes

### Three-Tier Structure Implementation

Each session should consistently implement:

1. **Core Concepts (For Everyone)**
   - Accessible explanations with analogies and visualizations
   - No code or math requirements
   - Clear "Understanding Check" questions

2. **Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)**
   - PyTorch code examples
   - Step-by-step implementation guidance
   - Practice exercises

3. **Advanced Theory (For the Curious)**
   - Mathematical formulations
   - Connections to research literature
   - Theoretical foundations

### Key Enhancements for All Sessions

- Add information bottleneck concept where relevant
- Implement search engine analogy for attention mechanisms
- Enhance visualization references
- Ensure code examples use PyTorch consistently
- Add clear tier navigation instructions

## Next Steps

1. Complete update of Module 1, Session 1.1 (s1.1-prompt.md)
2. Update remaining Module 1 sessions sequentially
3. Review and update Module 1 README
4. Move to Module 2 sessions
5. Move to Module 3 sessions
6. Create new Session 3.4
7. Final review for consistency

## Change Log

- **2025-05-06**: Completed updates to README.md, pre-prompt.md, and post-prompt.md
- **2025-05-06**: Created this status tracking document
