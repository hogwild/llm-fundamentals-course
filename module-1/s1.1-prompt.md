# Session 1.1: Understanding Next-Word Prediction

Primary Question: 
What is the core mechanism that powers LLMs, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Through this exploration, you'll discover how the core mechanism of LLMs - predicting what comes next - enables complex capabilities like answering questions and following instructions.

Part 1: The Prediction Game
- Ask the AI to generate 5 incomplete sentences for you to complete
- For each sentence, provide a word or phrase to continue it
- Ask the AI to explain whether your continuation was high or low probability based on its prediction model
- Discuss: What patterns did you notice? What makes some continuations more "natural" than others?

Part 2: From Prediction to Answers
- Ask the AI: "If your core mechanism is just predicting the next word, how do you generate answers to questions?"
- Explore the connection between continuation and response generation
- Key insight to discover: There's a pattern where "Question â†’ Answer" is a highly probable continuation!
- Ask the AI to demonstrate how the same mechanism produces both creative stories and factual answers

Part 3: The Emergence of Instruction Following
- Ask the AI to explain how instruction following emerges from next-word prediction
- Explore different types of instructions an AI might follow:
  * Information retrieval: "Tell me about the history of computers"
  * Mathematical operations: "Calculate 235 x 18"
  * Reasoning tasks: "Explain why trees are important for the environment"
  * Creative generation: "Write a short poem about autumn"
  * Procedural instructions: "Explain how to make chocolate chip cookies"
  * Classification: "Is this email a phishing attempt?"
  * Translation: "Translate this sentence to Spanish"
- Discuss whether next-word prediction is necessary and/or sufficient for these different types of instructions
- Consider: Are there instructions that would be difficult to follow through pure prediction?

Part 4: Reflection
- Summarize what you've learned about next-word prediction and instruction following in bullet points
- Consider how this understanding changes your perception of what LLMs can and cannot do
