# LLM4LLM Self-Evolution Prompt

## Purpose
You are tasked with analyzing the LLM4LLM educational curriculum and proposing improvements to its knowledge scaffolding, content organization, and technical accuracy. Your suggestions should respect the course's core philosophy while enhancing its educational effectiveness.

## Repository Analysis Instructions
1. First, thoroughly analyze the entire repository structure, paying special attention to:
   - Module organization and progression
   - Knowledge point sequencing within each module
   - Dependencies between concepts
   - The balance of theoretical and practical content
   - Coverage of emerging topics in language model development

2. Identify the pedagogical approach used in the repository:
   - How knowledge is scaffolded from simple to complex
   - What teaching techniques are employed consistently
   - How feedback and assessment are incorporated
   - What learning objectives are explicitly or implicitly stated

## Improvement Task Framework
Based on your analysis, perform the following tasks:

### 1. Knowledge Point Evolution
For each module in the curriculum:
- Evaluate the completeness and correctness of current knowledge points
- Identify concept gaps that should be filled with new knowledge points
- Suggest knowledge points that could be merged, split, or resequenced
- Propose entirely new knowledge points addressing emerging concepts or research
- Recommend knowledge points that should be removed or substantially revised

### 2. Pedagogical Enhancement
Analyze the teaching methodology and suggest improvements for:
- Cognitive load management in complex topics
- Progression between related concepts
- Balance between theory, implementation, and application
- Visualization and example effectiveness
- Assessment and feedback opportunities

### 3. Technical Currency Assessment
- Identify content that has become outdated due to recent developments
- Suggest updates to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques
- Recommend new references to recent research papers
- Propose revised code examples using current best practices
- Address any factual inaccuracies or obsolete explanations

### 4. Pull Request Generation
For each major improvement you identify:
1. Create a detailed pull request specification including:
   - PR title that clearly identifies the improvement
   - Complete description of proposed changes
   - Files that would be modified
   - New files that would be created
   - Explicit before/after examples for significant changes
   - Justification for why this change improves learning outcomes
   - References to supporting research or educational principles
   - Estimated implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High)
   - Priority level (Low/Medium/High) based on educational impact

2. For new knowledge points, provide:
   - Full knowledge point title
   - Recommended placement in the curriculum
   - Complete content including:
     - Probing questions
     - Core concepts
     - Hands-on implementations
     - Advanced theory components
     - Understanding checks
     - Connection to adjacent knowledge points

## Output Format
Structure your response as follows:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of your findings and high-priority recommendations (500 words maximum)

2. **Module-by-Module Analysis**: Detailed evaluation of each module with specific improvement suggestions

3. **Cross-Module Integration Recommendations**: Suggestions that span multiple modules

4. **New Content Proposals**: Fully specified new knowledge points or modules

5. **Pull Request Specifications**: Detailed PR specifications for each major recommendation

6. **Implementation Roadmap**: Suggested prioritization and sequencing of changes

## Constraints and Guidelines
- Maintain the repository's core educational philosophy of progressive learning
- Ensure recommendations are justified by educational principles or technical necessity
- Preserve the multi-audience approach that serves different levels of technical background
- Follow the established format for knowledge points while suggesting improvements
- Keep code examples consistent with the repository's implementation style
- Consider both technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness in all suggestions
- Maintain sufficient Python code examples throughout content
- Ensure all code is current, correct, and follows best practices

Your goal is to help this curriculum evolve organically while maintaining its core strengths and educational approach. Focus on concrete, actionable improvements rather than abstract criticisms.
